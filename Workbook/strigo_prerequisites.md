# Prerequisites

All the labs will be carried out using [`minikube`](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/).

In the labs, when commands are prefixed with "üíª (local)" you can ignore them.
On the opposite, if nothing is specified or they are prefixed with "‚òÅÔ∏è (cloud)", you must execute them.

You have at your disposal in the Strigo Lab a _`kubernetes`_ machine with `docker`, `minikube`, `kubectl` and `helm` already installed with autocompletion.

You have access to a Visual Studio Code via the 'code' button of the Lab Strigo.
The password is displayed when launching a terminal (or available in the file `~/.config/code-server/config.yaml`).
