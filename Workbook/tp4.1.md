## Lab 4.1: Services and Service Discovery

Goal: Create a service and check its behaviour

Duration: 0:15:00

### Preparation

- Create a _Namespace_ called `shopping`
- Create the _ReplicaSet_ `whoami` from the following descriptor (source: `~/workspaces/Lab4/rs--whoami--4.1.yml`):

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: whoami
  namespace: shopping
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: whoami
      level: expert
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: whoami
        level: expert
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: whoami
          image: traefik/whoami:v1.10
          ports:
            - name: main-port
              containerPort: 80
          args:
            - --verbose
```

### First Service creation

- Write a descriptor to create a _Service_ called `whoami` which listens on port _8080_ and will redirect traffic to all Pods that correspond to `app=whoami,level=expert` on port _80_ (the Service must also carry the labels `app=whoami,level=expert`)
- Complete the following template available in `~/workspaces/Lab4/svc--whoami.yml` by replacing `XXXX`, `YYYY` and `ZZ` with the right values.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: whoami
  namespace: shopping
  labels:
    stack: whoami
spec:
  selector:
    app: XXXX
    level: YYYY
  ports:
    - name: main
      protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
      targetPort: ZZ
```

- List the Services of the `shopping` namespace
- Show detailed information of `whoami` Service with `kubectl describe`
- Take a look at the `Enpoints` properties
- What is the IP of the Service in the cluster?

### Create a gateway Pod

- Create in the _Namespace_ `shopping` a `gateway` Pod from the following descriptor (source: `~/workspaces/Lab4/pod--gateway.yml`):

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gateway
  namespace: shopping
  labels:
    app: gw
spec:
  containers:
    - name: shell-in-pod
      image: zenika/k8s-training-tools:v5
      command:
        - bash
        - -c
        - sleep infinity
```

- Use `kubectl exec ...` or `k9s` to open a shell in the Pod and execute commands (replacing `clusterIp-du-svc-whoami` with the ClusterIP of your Service)
   - Service ping (which will not work): `ping -c 1 -W 1 <clusterIp-du-svc-whoami>`
   - Request the Service: `curl <clusterIp-du-svc-whoami>:8080/api`

### Does it still work when you kill the Pods?

- From the `gateway` Pod, run the command `curl <clusterIp-du-svc-whoami>:8080/api` several times and check that the `hostname` key returns different values
- Delete the 2 Pods associated with the _ReplicaSet_ `whoami`
- From the `gateway` Pod, run the command `curl <clusterIp-du-svc-whoami>:8080/api` several times and check that the `hostname` key returns different values from the previous ones

### What if we increase the number of replicas?

- Scale the _ReplicaSet_ `whoami` to 5 replicas
- From the `gateway` Pod, run the command `curl <clusterIp-du-svc-whoami>:8080/api` several times and check that the `hostname` key returns additional values compared to the previous case

### Using DNS

- Perform the same curl queries but using full (_fqdn_) and short DNS names

### Service with multiple ports (Optional)

- Create the _ReplicaSet_ `multi-ports` from the following descriptor (source: `~/workspaces/Lab4/rs--multi-ports.yml`):

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: multi-ports
  namespace: shopping
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: multi-ports
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: multi-ports
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: multi-ports-app
          image: alpine:3.16
          command:
            - ash
            - -c
            - (while true; do echo -ne "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nweb $(date)\n" | nc -l -p 80; done & while true; do echo -ne "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nadmin $(date -Iseconds)\n" | nc -l -p 1234; done)
          ports:
            - name: web-port
              containerPort: 80
            - name: admin-port
              containerPort: 1234
```

- Create the `multi-port` Service:
   - which redirects to Pods with `app=multi-ports`
   - which exposes port `web-port` on port 80 and port `admin-port` on port 8000
- Test from the `gateway` Pod:
   - `curl <ip-du-service>:80` must return a string like `"web Sun Feb 18 11:14:54 UTC 2024"`
   - `curl <ip-du-service>:8000` must return a string like `"admin 2024-02-18T11:14:54+00:00"`
